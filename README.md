# SnakeGame-Nokia3310
A Vanilla JavaScript Game

My first game using JavaScript.

The main focus was to get more comfortable with the vanilla JavaScript and -->

   * project set up
   * linking your JavaScript and CSS files to your HTML file
   * event listeners
   * query Selectors
   * arrow functions
   * forEach
   * setting time intervals and countdowns


Later I wish to add more personalised styling.

A huge thanks to Ania Kubow and Scrimba for helping me learn to kode.
